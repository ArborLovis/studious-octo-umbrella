 *  The timer 3 is handled as a general purpose Timer,
 *  also called GPTM.
 *  The aim is to generate a constant timer interval of
 *  64µs resolution. So within this resolution every other
 *  time can be build by counting a variable.
 *  By shifting left 6 times, the right time can be achieved.
